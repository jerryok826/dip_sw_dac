## Project Description
Dip_sw_dac is an attempt to build a simple but precise digital potentiometer. It takes the VCC input of 5v or 3.3v and produces a selectable output in 64 steps. It can replace a three turn potentiometer in some adjustment use cases. The right most switch selects vcc/2. The left most switch is vcc/64. So for example if the two rightmost switches are on the board will output 3.75 Volts with a 5V VCC. Enabling the leftmost switch will increase the output by 0.078 volts or 1/64 of 5V.
