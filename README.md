## Project Description
Dip_sw_dac is an attempt to build a simple but precise digital potentiometer. It takes the VCC input of 5v or 3.3v and produces a selectable output in 64 steps. Its replaces three a turn potentiometer. The right most switch seelcts vcc/2. The left most is vcc/32. I cannot remember labeling logic.
